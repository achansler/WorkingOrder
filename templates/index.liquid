      Change the grid item width by using classes from the grid in
      the grid_item_width variable.

      Example:
        - {% assign grid_item_width = 'large--one-third medium--one-half' %}
    {% endcomment %}
    {% include 'hero' %}
    {% include 'benefits' %}
    {% include 'how' %}
    {% include 'product-grid-item' %}
    {% include 'fact' %}
    {% include 'quotes' %}
    {% include 'about' %}


  {% else %}
